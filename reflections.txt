-------------Notes to Self------------------------------
1) Refactor
  format_date-This method should take in either 1 or 2 dates since TodoItem
  requires formatting 1 date, while EventItem could have up to 2 dates
  format_priority
2) error.rb- group together all your error message classes. Code in app.rb should test error messages
Add error checking to the add and delete methods that raise errors when:
The user tries to add an unsupported item type
The user tries to delete an item from the list that exceeds the boundaries of the list (e.g., tries to delete item #4 when there are only 3 items in the list)
Tries to set an item‚Äôs priority to an invalid value (e.g., priority: ‚Äúüí©‚Äù)
