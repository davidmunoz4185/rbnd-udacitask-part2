# REFLECTIONS
# -------------------------------------------------------
1. How long did you spend working on this project?
More than 2 weeks (more or less) from the beginning of Lesson 7
2. What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
The use of modules and gems, in my opinion are amazing and so powerful just to find a solution for a problem you could have
3. What two additional features did you build? Why?
A Menu using highline gem, a formatted table using Terminal-Table and adding a new list from the menu.
4. Where do you still have room to grow?
This is becoming so difficult but I am very excited to keep learning, but I am afraid I am not going to have enough time to finish this nanodegree. I hope
Ruby on Rails nanodegree starts shortly in order to have more knowledge about these amazing technologies.
